# Technical Specifications

This document outlines the technical specifications and established patterns for the Portal Prototype.

## Code Organization

The codebase follows the Next.js App Router organization:

- `/app`: Core application code
  - Top-level folders represent routes
  - `page.tsx` files define the UI for each route
  - Shared components are placed in the `/components` directory
  - Utility functions in `/utils`
  - API routes in `/api`
  - CSS modules colocated with their components

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript for type safety
- Strict null checks enabled
- No use of `any` type except in rare, documented cases
- Components use React functional components with hooks
- Components should be small and focused (under 300 lines)
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Design Patterns

- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from smaller components
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separating data fetching from UI rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: Extracting reusable stateful logic into hooks
- **Module Pattern**: Organizing related functionality into modules with clear interfaces
- **Utility Functions**: Pure functions for data manipulation and formatting

## Technical Decisions

### Next.js App Router

The project uses Next.js App Router for several reasons:
- Server components for improved performance
- Built-in API routes
- File-based routing system
- Built-in optimizations for images and fonts
- TypeScript support

### CSS Modules

CSS Modules were chosen over other styling solutions to:
- Ensure CSS scoping to components
- Maintain familiar CSS syntax
- Avoid runtime CSS-in-JS overhead
- Leverage Next.js built-in support

## Libraries and Frameworks

- **Next.js**: React framework for production
- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type checking for JavaScript
- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting

## API Documentation

### User API

- **GET /api/user**
  - Returns user data
  - No parameters required
  - Response: User object

- **PUT /api/user**
  - Updates user data
  - Request Body: Partial user object
  - Response: Updated user object

## Database Schema

Currently using mock data. Planned schema:

```
User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  role: string
  joinDate: string
  settings: {
    notifications: boolean
    privacy: {
      showEmail: boolean
      showActivity: boolean
    }
    theme: string
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Server components for initial page loads
- Client components for interactive elements
- CSS Modules for scoped styling without runtime cost
- Lazy loading for routes
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
